# Event-Driven Kafka Pipeline (C# + Confluent Kafka)

This project demonstrates a **Kafka event streaming pipeline** built with `.NET 8`, using **producers**, **validators**, and **analytics consumers** to simulate real-time purchase events and track analytics.

It showcases:
- âœ… Event modeling with `PurchaseEvent`
- âœ… Real-time validation and message filtering
- âœ… Asynchronous Kafka production and consumption
- âœ… In-memory analytics on streaming data
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns across 3 projects

## Project Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Common/                 # Shared models and topic names
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Models/PurchaseEvent.cs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ KafkaTopics.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ Producer/              # Sends random purchase events to Kafka
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ producer.cs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ analyticsproducer.cs (demo only)
â”œâ”€â”€ Consumer/              # Two consumers:
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Validator.cs       # Validates and forwards messages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Analytics.cs       # Performs in-memory analytics

How It Works 
ðŸŸ¢ 1. Producer.cs â€” Simulates Purchases

    Randomly generates users and items.

    Creates a PurchaseEvent object.

    Serializes to JSON.

    Sends the event to Kafka topic: purchases.

Key Technologies:
ProducerBuilder, JsonSerializer, KafkaTopics.Purchases
ðŸŸ¡ 2. Validator.cs â€” Cleans the Data

    Subscribed to the purchases topic.

    Validates each message:

        Must contain UserId and Item.

        Must be valid JSON.

    Forwards only valid messages to processed-purchases topic.

Key Technologies:
ConsumerBuilder, ProduceAsync, JsonSerializer, error handling
ðŸ”µ 3. Analytics.cs â€” Real-Time Insights

    Subscribed to processed-purchases.

    Deserializes events and updates:

        ðŸ“Š Purchase count per user

        ðŸ“¦ Total count of items sold

    Prints a simple snapshot every 5 messages.

Key Technologies:
Dictionary<string, int>, live counters, analytics snapshot display
Topics Used
Kafka Topic	Purpose
purchases	Raw user purchase events
processed-purchases	Validated purchase events
analytics	(Optional) direct messages for demo
